                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">Jarrod Petree has spent his whole life throwing. The first things he threw, according to his mother, were assorted toys and a fair amount of food from the highchair. Before long, he moved on to throwing balls. Some babies, of course, are throwers. But from the very start, Jarrod had an especially determined arm. At least this is the view taken by his father, Tim, who played Division II baseball at the Florida Institute of Technology in the late 80's, graduating only a few years before his son was born: the kid basically arrived on earth wanting to throw.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">Nowadays, Jarrod is 5-foot-3 and weighs 110 pounds. He is a recent graduate of the sixth grade at Apopka Memorial Middle School in suburban Orlando, and arguably as close to being a professional baseball player as a 12-year-old can be. He has buzz-cut blond hair, a solid tan and what seems to be a perpetual raspberry on his left arm — the product of diving, again and again, headlong toward second base. He is also a dedicated sleepwalker, piloted by his unconscious, especially on nights before a big game. "We've found him out in the yard, in the garage," Tim says. "When we're on the road, he'll wander around the motel. Usually it means he's going to play well."</p>

                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">Along with 12 other boys his age, Jarrod plays for a traveling baseball team called the Central Florida Express, one of the best 12-and-under teams in the country. The team's head coach, a coin-op laundry entrepreneur named Ben Nichols, started the Express four years ago, primarily so that his son, Brad, an exceptional second baseman who was then 8, could have some exceptional teammates. Someone told him about another 8-year-old playing in a local recreational league who fit the bill, and one afternoon Ben Nichols drove over to watch Jarrod Petree play. Tim Petree describes Ben as having rescued Jarrod from what he calls "rec-ball hell." Taking the field with children who were just learning to play — who couldn't field a zinging line drive or get their glove around a crisp throw from third base — had been troublesome. "He was going to end up hurting somebody," says Tim, who has been practicing baseball with Jarrod since he was 2. "We couldn't get out of there fast enough."</p>

                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">Though he also plays shortstop and third base for the Express, Jarrod is primarily known for his role as a big-game pitcher — a precision right-hander whose fastball is somewhat less fast than those heaved by bigger kids who've hit puberty already, but which nonetheless tends to cross the plate with uncanny and merciless accuracy. At the end of last year, Jarrod was listed as one of the top players of his age in the country by a Web site called Travel Ball Select.</p>

                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">While his teammates will jabber on the field, ferociously chewing Dubble Bubble or handfuls of sunflower seeds, Jarrod seems tuned to a lower frequency, throwing his sliders and curveballs and changeups without so much as a glance toward the stands. When he strikes someone out, he reflexively clenches his right fist — a celebratory gesture so small you have to pay attention to see it. Tim, who is the team's pitching coach, sits on a bucket next to the dugout during games and signals to the catcher his choice for the next pitch and over which corner of the plate it should pass. Whatever his dad calls for, that's what Jarrod throws. "I've never seen a little boy go out there and hit spots like that all day long," says Joe Winker, an assistant coach for the Express. "It's pretty cool to watch."</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">Coached and financed by parents, with the help of a handful of local sponsors, the Express, which is based north of Orlando, plays what amounts to a 10-month season, taking time off at the end of August and again at Christmas. The players spend the rest of the year traveling to multiple states and slugging it out against other elite-level, baseball-obsessed kids in weekend tournaments where the winning teams are sometimes required to play up to eight games in a single 48-hour stretch. Last year, the Express team had 70 wins and 9 losses, and won the coveted Amateur Athletic Union national championship in its age group for the third year in a row. Due largely to its reputation, the team now has players on its roster whose parents think nothing of driving an hour and a half each way from Tampa or Gainesville for the twice-weekly practices. One player, a freckled kid named Zac Ryan, even flies in from northern Indiana to play.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">All this has made the Express a particularly alluring team to try to beat. "We're kind of like the Yankees," Jarrod explained one night in late April. He lay sprawled on the carpet in his family's living room, idly watching basketball highlights on ESPN and scratching the nose of the family's beagle, Zoey. "We have a target on our back all the time," he said. "People pretty much hate us."</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">In the next room, Jarrod's younger sisters, Analyse and Kaylie, were getting ready for bed. Analyse is 8 and plays fast-pitch softball in a local Babe Ruth League. Kaylie is 10 and isn't much interested in sports. ("We call her Fangirl," Tim joked. "She plays Barbies in the bleachers.")</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">Tim has negotiated for flextime at his job as a DNA analyzer for the state's crime lab so that he can coach and travel with the Express. Jarrod's mom, Lori, who is dark-haired and pretty with a wry sense of humor, runs a small day care center from the family's stucco home. There was a time when the Petrees liked to drive to the beach on weekends, but weekends are now all about Jarrod's baseball — and, to a lesser extent, Analyse's softball. Last summer, as a concession to leisure, the family had a heated pool put in behind the house. Tim recently sawed down two oak trees that stood in the narrow strip of remaining backyard to make room for the pitcher's mound that he intends to build out there. "Our bullpen," he called it.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">While his parents say they understand that the odds are vastly against him, Jarrod has big plans for himself: playing for the Red Sox, his dad's favorite team. More specifically, he'll face his best friend and teammate on the Express, Jesse Winker, probably in a pitching duel and definitely in the run-up to the World Series. And Jesse will be playing for the Yankees, his dad's favorite team.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="card-text mt-4">"But if I don't get drafted in an early round out of high school, I'll go to college," Jarrod said, still playing with the dog. His backup plan, he explained, is to become a crime-lab scientist like his father, or possibly a phys ed teacher, but this is only if his arm fails him. And nobody wants that to happen. A moment later, Zoey started to gnaw playfully on a couple of Jarrod's lanky fingers. His mother, sitting on the couch nearby, instantly raised an alarm. "Pitching hand! Pitching hand!" she called, until her son quietly extracted his fingers from the dog's mouth. She said this lightheartedly — joking, but only a little.</p>
